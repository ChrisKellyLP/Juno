The [Decentralized Identity Foundation](https://identity.foundation/) organization (also known as **DIF**) was formed as a [Joint Development Foundation](https://www.jointdevelopment.org/) project in 2017 and has grown to be a major venue for IPR-protected co-development among large and small industry players. It has historically focused on the development of both working open-source code and pre-standard specifications for decentralized identity, but it is starting to branch out into non-technical forms of cooperation for the purposes of market-building and to promote all open decentralized identity technology, whether created in DIF or elsewhere.

Currently, DIF has a diverse, international membership, including over 300 member companies, universities, and government agencies that are collaboratively developing the broader space of decentralized identities. 

There are 9 technical working groups, 3 business interest groups, and 4 different open groups to bring together members with shared interests, common goals, and a desire to collaborate.
